I write software that ships.

My work spans pixel-perfect React frontends, bulletproof Node/Express backends, and the occasional DevOps pipeline that actually works first time. I build with React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Tailwind, and whatever tool makes the product better. Currently advancing my DevOps skills while feeding my curiosity for zero-downtime deployments — because the best applications never go down on their users.

### Crafting Scalable Digital Experiences
I'm a full-stack engineer who’s spent the last 2+ years turning startup ideas into production-grade applications that users actually love and investors actually fund. Whether it’s a MongoDB-powered dashboard or a PostgreSQL-backed SaaS platform, I make sure it’s fast, maintainable, and ready to 10x.

I'm currently working on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and AWS automation projects to streamline deployments and build truly resilient systems. While keeping the system-design and DSA muscles strong, I'm always open to collaborating on ambitious projects — especially those that demand clean architecture and smart optimizations.
